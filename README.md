# Context

Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, we use information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

# Goal of the project

The goal of the project, aside from building a ML model, are the following:
*   Show how to perform an EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
*   Show different methods to tackle the problem of unbalanced classes
*   Show how to compare performances on predictions with the train and the test set
*   Show how to perform cross validation

## Caveat

In this project, we focus on just one ML algorithm(Logistic Regression). Besides, the fine-tuning of the parameters is not performed.
Therefore, it is very likely that the current code will be updated in the future.
